Why? Perl 5 is a highly portable, stable and dependable technology, since a
very long time.  This is the version I use for validating my scripts for
backward compatibility.

This source tree starts with Perl v5.8.9 (perl-5.8.9.tar.gz) which was
released in 2008-12-16, according to [1].

This MUST be used only for development and validation.

There is a 'build.sh' script that uses "~/local" as prefix, it will build, test
and install there, it is trivial to customize it.

See README.orig for the original README.
